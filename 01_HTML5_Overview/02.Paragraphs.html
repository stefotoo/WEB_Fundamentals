    <h2><i>Germany star, Marco Reus, has reportedly refused to sign a new contract with Borussia Dortmund.</i></h2>

    <p>The 25-year-old still has a deal until 30 June 2016, but it includes a buyout clause which Dortmund would like to
        delete from the contract

        Due to this clause, reportedly only €25 million, Dortmund may be forced to sell him under his value of around
        €50
        next summer to prevent losing another player for free the following year, after Robert Lewandowski moved to
        Bayern
        on a free transfer this summer.</p>

    <p><b>Dortmund have previously indicated that they will fend off any interest from other clubs to keep their Player
        of
        the
        Season, but their hands may be tied if Reus wants to leave.</b></p>

    <p><em><strong>Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are reportedly best positioned to sign him and some reports claim he
        already has agreed
        to a deal in principle with Los Blancos.

        The situation is similar to that of Toni Kroos, who left Bayern this summer before his contract would have ran
        out
        next June. Kroos and Reus coincidently also have the same agent, Volker Struth.

        However, other clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal are also interested in the player.

        Reus has scored 43 goals and assisted further 40 in 96 goals for Dortmund, but is currently side-lined with an
        ankle
        injury.</strong></em></p>
